Web based registration system for colleges
This system implements the functions needed in order to run an online

school-registration with the use of a back end database, and Hypertext Markup 

Language(HTML) web-based front end. The website that has been created for the mock 

college, SUNY Gold, intends to provide solutions to the needs of students, faculty 

members, admins, and researchers. Functions include the ability to register for classes, 

view one’s transcript, view one’s schedule, and more. Faculty are able to conduct 

operational functions including, but not limited to, assign grades and mark attendance. 

While admins have the liberty of adding courses, deleting courses, assigning advisors, 

and more. Lastly, researchers can enjoy the ability to conduct various search functions 

in order to view data on SUNY Gold.
